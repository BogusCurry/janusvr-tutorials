<p>Let's make some shapes!  JanusVR has several built-in shapes that you can use to build your world.  Let's add one of each to the world we created in the first step, and lay them out in a circle.  We'll give them some colors, too.

<pre>
    &lt;Object id="sphere"   pos="0 1 3"       col="1 0 0" /&gt;
    &lt;Object id="cube"     pos="1.9 1 2.3"   col="0 1 0" /&gt;
    &lt;Object id="cone"     pos="3.0 1 0.5"   col="0 0 1" /&gt;
    &lt;Object id="cylinder" pos="2.6 1 -1.5"  col="1 1 0" /&gt;
    &lt;Object id="capsule"  pos="1.0 1 -2.8"  col="1 0 1" /&gt;
    &lt;Object id="pipe"     pos="-1.0 1 -2.8" col="0 1 1" /&gt;
    &lt;Object id="plane"    pos="-2.6 1 -1.5" col="1 .5 0" /&gt;
    &lt;Object id="pyramid"  pos="-3.0 1 0.5"  col=".2 .5 1" /&gt;
    &lt;Object id="torus"    pos="-1.9 1 2.3"  col=".5 .8 .2" /&gt;
</pre>

<p>Where did we get those numbers for the object positions, you ask?  With math, of course!  We want to organize everything in a circle around the center of the room, with a nice comfortable 3m radius.  
<p>A circle is 360 degrees, aka 2*PI radians, and we have 9 objects to place in a circle.  So by dividing the size of the circle by the number of items, we find that we should place the item every 40 degrees, or 0.7 radians.  
<p>We can then use some basic trigonometry to turn those into (x,y,z) coordinates for each item:


<pre>var numItems = 9,
    radius = 3,
    stepSize = 2 * Math.PI / numItems;

for (var i = 0; i < numItems; i++) {
  var x = Math.sin(i * stepSize) * radius,
      y = 1,
      z = Math.cos(i * stepSize) * radius;
  console.log(i, x.toFixed(1) + ' ' + y + ' ' + z.toFixed(1))
}</pre>
